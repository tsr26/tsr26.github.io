   var houseinfo = '<h1>My House</h1><p>We moved here when I was 7 years old when my dad got a job at BYU-Hawaii teaching Chinese and Spanish. I lived in this triplex up until my mission to South Korea in 2012. Most people that live in Provo have never lived so close to a temple, but as can be seen here, the Laie, HI Temple was basically in my backyard.</p>';
   var schoolinfo = '<h1>"My" School</h1><p>This isnt really my school because I was homeschooled growing up, but if I had gone to a public elementary school this would have been it. I would sometimes go with my dad and brothers to play on the basketball courts here in the evenings.</p>';
   var churchinfo = '<h1>Church</h1><p>This church building is affectionately nicknamed the "back chapel" as it was built right behind another church building. Both wards that I grew up attending in Hawaii used this ward building. It actually has a couple of inner courtyards that have open roofs.</p>';
   var hukilauinfo = '<h1>Hukilau</h1><p>Hukilau is a popular local beach that is well loved by the locals. It it great for swimming and body boarding and is very family friendly. It is close enough to BYU-Hawaii that students could walk here in 5-10 minutes.</p>';
   var byuhinfo = '<h1>BYU-Hawaii</h1><p>I attended BYU-Hawaii for just over a year before my mission to South Korea. The diversity of people that attend here is incredible! If BYU-H would have had an engineering program I would probably never have left :)</p>';
